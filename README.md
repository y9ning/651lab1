successfully logged in, the url will automatically go to index page (using url_for).

  On Index page, if user does not log in to the database, upper left corner will show

In the Search area, type in information such as book tile, isbn_10, or author name
to search for books whose title, author, or isbn_10 contains the input text. If
no matched are found, then the short text at the bottom will say "no book found".
